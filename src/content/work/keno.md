In my daily work, I am involved in the development of a B2B platform for a leading distributor and manufacturer in the RES industry. I joined the project during the development phase, when the platform was published in its basic version. I had the opportunity to participate in the platform's development, implementing new features and shaping its current functionality.

I was responsible for, among other things:

- Implementation of advanced product configurators enabling comprehensive personalization of RES systems (solar collectors, heat pumps, air conditioners)
- Design and development of an administrator panel for managing content and product configurations
- Creation of a marketing notification system with advanced targeting and personalization
- Development of a system for setting promotions and weekly highlights
- Creation of various reports for platform activity analysis
- Implementation of new functionalities based on user needs and optimization of existing solutions in terms of performance and UX
