As a Fronted Developer, I play a key role in developing an innovative B2B platform for a leading distributor and manufacturer in the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) industry. Having joined during the early development phase, I've been instrumental in evolving the platform from its basic version to a comprehensive solution with advanced functionalities.

My key contributions include:

- Designing and implementing sophisticated product configurators enabling detailed customization of renewable energy systems including solar collectors, heat pumps, and air conditioning units
- Developing a comprehensive administrator panel with intuitive interfaces for content management and product configuration
- Creating an advanced marketing notification system with precise targeting capabilities and personalization options
- Implementing a dynamic promotion management system including weekly featured products
- Developing an automated warranty extension generation system
- Building custom analytical reporting tools providing actionable insights on platform usage and performance
- Continuously enhancing platform functionality based on user feedback while optimizing existing features for improved performance and user experience
